# DJI-Flight-Logger
DJI-Flight-Logger is a tool designed to easily organize files created by a DJI drone. This
project is **_highly W.I.P._**, so expect things to look and function like garbage.

### Project Status
This is still heavily under construction. I've never really properly released software or 
used any kind of version control, so I'm sure there'll be a few bumps here and there. As it
is, this is my 3rd time making this repo.

### Project Goals
My end goal for this project is a tool that you can run after plugging in your SD card, and have 
all your footage organized and copied into separate folders by flight number or flight date.

### Project Usefulness
The odds are, if you know Python, you can do a better job at this than I can. I'm still keeping 
the project public just to hold myself accountable, while learning to release software and use 
version control.


#### TL;DR: Feel free to check things out if you want, but don't expect anything impressive.
